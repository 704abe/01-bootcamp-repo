WHAT I DID

Created a new directory 'first-day'

Created a file 'index.html' in that directory

Created a copy 'index-copy.html' of that file in the same directory 

Created a new directory 'first-day-2' in the same directory '02-Stu_Command-Line' as 'first day'

Moved 'index-copy.html' to '02-Stu_Command-Line' using command 'mv ..'

Moved 'index-copy.html' to 'first-day-2'

Created a copy 'index-copy-2.html' of 'index-copy.html' in 'first-day-2'

Moved 'index-copy-2.html' to '02-Stu_Command-Line' 

Moved 'index-copy-2.html' to 'first-day'
